	<p> Download the pre-pre aplha verision of the game which is just a boss battle (for now). DISCLAIMER: THIS IS VERY VERY VERY VERY PRE ALPHA EXPECT MANY MANY BUGS!</p>
	<p> When you download it, Google will say that it is dangerous, but just press the arrow near discard and press keep, then when you start it windows defender will pop up so just click more info under the explanation and then run anyway. You trust me, right? <p>
