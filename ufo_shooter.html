	<p> UFO Shooter is still being developed so expect some bugs. Otherwise, have fun! W, A, S, D to move and Left Click to shoot!
	<p> Patch 1.2:
		This is the biggest patch so far!
		Added ammo to the game.
		Added a GUI.
		Added special drops.
		Fixed the dificulty of Hard Mode.
		Added a surprise!
		You can now press ESC to end the game (pause comming soon).
		This is most likely going to be the last major update for the game, I will now move on to the next game which you will see soon!
